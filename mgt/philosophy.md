
If we think of all the possible attributes of the product as points in space,
the requirements define the points which **must** be included in our product.
The user stories describe other points that will be included in the product.
So really, requirements are just a special class of user story.

Every user story has _acceptance criteria_. The acceptance criteria are
objective, unambiguous statements which will be true if the user story is
satisfied. All of a user story's criteria will be true if and only if the
user story is satisfied. So the user story tells you where
you want to get, the acceptance criteria is how you know whether or not you're
there.

Each acceptance criteria also has one or more unit test associated with it.
These are automated tests which will attempt to verify that the acceptance
criteria is met.
